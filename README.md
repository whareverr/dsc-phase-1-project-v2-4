##### Overview

The project for Microsoft's new movie studio aims to get insights from various movie datasets to inform strategic decision-making. 

Microsoft seeks to enter the film industry by understanding the types of films currently succeeding at the box office. This project will delve into datasets sourced from platforms like Box Office Mojo, IMDB and TheMovieDB. 

By conducting thorough analysis, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and preferences within the movie industry to provide actionable recommendations for Microsoft's movie studio. 

##### Business Understanding

The primary objective of this project is to equip  Microsoft's new movie studio with comprehensive insights into the film industry. 

By conducting thorough data analysis, we aim to provide recommendations that will enable Microsoft to make well-informed decisions regarding the types of films to produce.

While Microsoft has expertise in a variety of technology disciplines, it lacks firsthand familiarity with the film industry's many complexities. 

Recognizing the growing demand for original video content and the success stories of other major companies in this space, Microsoft sees an opportunity to use its resources and capabilities to stake out a place in the entertainment industry.

Business Questions are :
What movie genres are currently dominating the box office? 
What trends can be detected within the dominating movie genres?
What are the primary factors influencing the success of recent film releases?
How do audience demographics affect movie tastes and box office performance?
Are there any developing trends or possibilities in the film business that Microsoft can leverage on?

##### Data Understanding and Analysis

**Box Office Mojo Dataset**: This dataset contains 3387 entries (movies) and 5 columns. Each row represents a movie, and each column provides specific information about that movie. Column names are title, studio, domestic_gross, foreign_gross and year. The dataset includes a combination of data types, including objects (strings), floats, and integers. 

**IMDB Dataset**: The IMDB dataset consists of several tables including 'movie_basics', 'directors', 'known_for', 'movie_akas', 'movie_ratings', 'persons', 'principals', and 'writers'. The specific data types are a mix of object (string) and numeric data types. The tables used were movie_basics and movie_ratings.

**The MovieDB Dataset**: There are 26517 entries in the dataset and 9 columns. The column names are 'genre_ids', 'id', 'original_language', 'original_title', 'popularity', 'release_date', 'title', 'vote_average', and 'vote_count'. Data types are object(str), float and integer

 Data was prepared, ensuring its accuracy and completeness, by removing any inconsistencies or errors to ensure reliable insights.
 Afterwards both data visualizations and statistical analysis techniques were used to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the datasets. 
 
Through visualizations like graphs, the data was in an easy-to-understand format.
 Statistical analyses was conducted to delve deeper into the data, identifying correlations, trends, and significant relationships between variables.
